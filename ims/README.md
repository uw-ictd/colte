# Clearwater IMS: Still a Work-in-Progress!
Clearwater is an opens source SIP/IMS server meant for massive-scale cloud deployments. They offer EC2 images, an "all in one" VirtualBox image that's not actually configurable, Docker containers, and build instructions. Everything is based on Ubuntu 14.04 and doesn't compile on Debian.
