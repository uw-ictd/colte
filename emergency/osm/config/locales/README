This directory contains all the translations for the openstreetmap.org website.

Do NOT edit any translations in here, please use translatewiki.net instead.

The only file in this directory that should be edited by hand is en.yml, when
localisation strings change or new translations are introduced. All other
languages _need_ to be edited using translatewiki.net. Please make sure that you
run the tests using *rake test* to make sure that there are no errors, as there
is at least one test that makes sure that all translations are valid (we'll
makes sure that they won't cause the site to not work).

There is more information about translating the website on the wiki at
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Website_Internationalization.
