    An implementation of the Evolved Packet Core network.
    
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
  Openair-cn is an implementation of the 3GPP specifications concerning the 
  Evolved Packet Core Networks, that means it contains the implementation of the
  following network elements: MME, HSS, S-GW, P-GW.

Licence info  
#---------------------
  The source code is mainly written under the FreeBSD License. For more details,
  please read the NOTICE file in the same directory.
   
#---------------------
Linux
#---------------------
  The Openair-cn code actually is written, executed, and tested on UBUNTU 
  desktop 14.04 64 bits.
  Actually the S-GW network element requires a linux kernel version 3.19.

Collaborative work
#---------------------
  This source code is managed through a GITLAB, a collaborative development 
  platform, URL: https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openair-cn

Contributions request
#---------------------
  In a general way, anybody who is willing can contribute on any part of the 
  code in any network component. Contributions can be simple bugfixes, advices
  and remarks on the design, architecture, coding/implementation, are can can 
  size up to a project collaboration.
  
  There are large areas where help is needed, and some more specifics:
  
    # By order of decreasing priority level:
  
      - Development of test tools: eNB(s) emulator on S1 interface.
      
      - Enhance the implementation of the HSS, many things are missing there.
      
      - Re-implement a GTPv1-U framework in S-GW using a 'zero-copy' framework.
      
      - Enhance the NAS layer with compliant TAU and SR procedures, implement 
        the handling of dedicated bearers in NAS and S/P-GW.

      - Propagate the use of ITTI inside the NAS for exchanges between EMM and 
        ESM.

      - Improve the design and implementation of the InTer-Task-Interface 
        middleware, a message passing software.
      
      - Enhance the S1AP MME application with the handling of new messages.

      - Help documenting, cleaning and harmonizing the source code.

    If you wish to contribute to the OAI documentation on Gilab wiki, then 
    please email to openair_tech (at) eurecom (dot) fr to sign the licence 
    agreement and request for account access on Gilab wiki.
    Follow the coding/Gitlab branching guidelines here.
    Work closely with the OAI community to ensure periodic review takes place 
    with them so you code can be merged to the main repository.
    Use Gitlab for collaborative development, bug fixing, feature requests, etc.
